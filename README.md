# random-coding
This repo consists of coding challenges I have done, and added to afterward.


### Summary
I aim to continually update this repo with any new coding challenges I have done, or refinements/fixes done to existing code (It's rather messy/inaccurate right now)

Also, I need a lot more practice doing these kinds of coding challenges.

This repo is also for me to learn how to use git properly - With the creation of feature branches, pull requests, and merge requests.
